# MMusick Blog HW 1.1

This week was such a bymmer. I hate this. I think that drawing through code, could be really interesting, but it seems slightly convoluted. 

It took me about 15 hours this week to complete my drawing. My drawing is based on the monster in my nightmares from when I was 2. He used tp really scare me.
